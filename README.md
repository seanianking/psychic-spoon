## Welcome to the campaign!

This portfolio site is built as if it were a character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons. The reasoning behind this format is that I am a firm believer that everyone has a different background and skillset that contributes something important to the team, and there is 20 sides to every story.

### Backstory page

The Backstory page gives a little bit about me, and how I came to be where I am now. It will give you advantage on your insight check to get to know me. I look forward to telling you my story!

### Skills/Proficiencies page

This is the place to find out what I'm good at. Being a full-stack developer leads to learning a lot of skills, and adding proficiency bonuses to a lot of abilities. 

### Adventures!

The greatest part of being an adventurer is the many places you get to go and the steps you take along the way. Learning while on adventures is one of the most rewarding experiences that I've had.

### Send Message

Message is such a versatile spell. Casting this spell will let you reach out to me in a variety of ways. I look forward to hearing from you!
